    <div id="mvc">
        <h2>Client-Side Model-View-Controller</h2>
        <img src="./images/mvc_diagram.PNG">
        <p>As you can see in the class diagram, our client architecture follows the MVC pattern strictly. We have a
            "Controller" that is responsible for the communication to the server. The "Controller" stores the data from
            the server using the "Model" and visualizes it using the "View".
        </p>
        <p>The "Model" represents the data that is necessary for a game of poker. We implemented it using a "PokerTable"
            class that represents the current game status. This status includes the pot, dealer, blinds, and more. The
            "Player" objects are also placed in the "PokerTable", and our "PokerTable" has four players. As you know, in
            poker, each of the Players has two cards during the round.</p>
        <p>On the side of the "View", we used SVG. Our Svg class uses SvSuit to display the suits of the cards. The Svg
            class has one SelfPlayer object and three OtherPlayer objects. Both SelfPlayer and OtherPlayer are inherited
            from SvgPlayer.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="networking">
        <h2>Messaging between server and client via WebSockets </h2>

        <p>Static assets (Javascript, HTML, CSS) are initially loaded via GET requests from the server. After initial
            loading, all communication is done via websockets.
            On Client side, websocket communication is handled with pure Javascript code. Server side, the npm package
            “ws” is used for easier handling.
        </p>
        <p>The client first sends a “join” request to the server, including the chosen nickname. If joining was
            successful on the server side(valid username given and table is not full yet) a ‘success’ message is sent
            back to the client. All other clients receive a ‘otherJoin’ message to inform them of the new player. From
            now on, all game actions are sent via ‘action’ messages from the client. The server in return sends a
            ‘tablestatus’ message to all clients, with the updated game status. When the game is finished, the server
            sends a ‘gameResult’ message to all clients, informing them of the winner and ending the game.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/server_client_sequence.PNG">
        <p>All message payloads are sent in JSON format. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="server_logic">
        <h2>Server logic</h2>
        <p>The server handles all of the logic that is needed for playing the game. Everything game related is stored in
            a PokerTable object as well as in some other support classes. The server receives a message from the client
            with a msg.type and invokes functions from the PokerTable class. The Clients are stored as Player objects.
        </p>
        <p>At the start of each round a deck of cards is generated, cards are dealt randomly and stored in either the
            Player objects or member variables of the Pokertable. After that the whole Pokertable is set up with
            starting bets dealer button positions and options for the player.
            After that the server waits for the player to perform an action which is then sent to the server via a
            message with the type ‘action’. That message contains the option the player chose. It can be one of the
            four: raise, call, allin or fold.
        </p>
        <p>The server then handles the option chosen by the player by adjusting all the necessary variables. Then a
            message with the updated Pokertable is sent to all players. If the last round is reached or all players are
            out of options the winner is determined. For this we used an open source tool called pokersolver<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>When a round is resolved the Pokertable is reset and a new round is started and a delayed message is sent to
            all players. </p>

    <div id="client">
        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p>In this section, we present the tasks that our client accomplishes. We decided to implement the game logic on
            the server. Therefore, our client is more focused on communication with the server (see "Messaging between
            server and client via WebSockets"), storing the game status, visualizing the game status (see "SVG/View"),
            interacting with the user, and sending game actions to the server, and storing game statistics. Here we want
            to take a quick look at the latter two.</p>
        <p>Our client is responsible for visualizing the current game status but also to take input from the user and
            send it to the server. In the case of a poker game, there are the options "Raise", "Check/Call", "Fold" and
            "All In". Depending on the current game status, the client only allows the currently possible actions to be
            taken by the user. We implemented this by sending all possible actions to the client and enabling/disabling
            the respective buttons. For the "Raise" action, we always doubled the current highest bet; there is no
            option to input an amount here. Going "All In" is always possible, as long as you are still in the game and
            did not yet fold. To make use of Drag&Drop, we added an image of chips that can be dragged on the poker
            table. Should a player do this, all his money goes into the pot.</p>
        <p>Another feature that we implemented on the client is game statistics. To realize this, we use the
            localStorage in the browser. What we store are two values, the total number of played games and the games
            that were won. From this, we calculate the number of lost games and the win ratio. We show the player these
            four values (total games, games lost, games won, win ratio) when he clicks on the button "Statistics" on the
            join screen.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="svg_view">
        <h2>SVG/View</h2>

        <p>SVG instead of Canvas (Styling with CSS, Responsiveness, not so many objects)
            Though we planned using Canvas, we decided to use SVG instead, because this way the drawing of the objects
            and the styling of them can be separated nicely between JS and CSS. Also SVG better supports responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>A disadvantage of SVG is its performance, however since we only had a few objects to draw (limited number of
            cards/players, buttons, etc.) and also the frequency of the re-draws was going to be rather low, the
            performance wasn’t that big of a factor.
        </p>
        <h3>Reuse of elements</h3>
        <p>SVG also allows for defining elements that can be referenced later, e.g. a gaussian blur filter was created
            once at the start of the SVG, and then can be referenced from anywhere within the SVG by referencing its ID
            #blurFilter.</p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_1.PNG">
        <br/>
        <p>A similar approach that we employed was making use of the
            &lt;use &gt; element to reference objects that can be used multiple times from anywhere in the document. The
            elements representing the card values are a good example, because those have a good chance to appear
            multiple times in the document.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_2.PNG">

        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p>The cool thing about SVG is that it can be animated with pure CSS. We used this approach to animate the
            following elements and actions:</p>
        <p><b>Active Player</b></p>
        <p>In the JS an SVG Ellipse is created and the CSS class ‘scale-pulse’ is applied to it. Also a gaussian blur
            filter was applied so that the ellipse’s border appears a little smoother. The filter was created earlier
            and is just referenced here. </p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_3.PNG">
        <p>The CSS class states the keyframed animation that should be used.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_4.PNG">
        <p><b>Speech bubbles & Dealing Cards</b></p>
        <p>Speech bubbles and cards have been animated by applying a CSS class with a keyframed animation that changes
            the elements opacity, to fade the element in or out respectively.</p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_5.PNG">
        <p>On the JS side, the fadein and fadeout classes have been applied as follows for the speech bubbles:</p>
        <img src="./images/code_snipped_6.PNG">
        <p>A timeout was set to have the bubble shown for a certain amount of time after fading it out again. After the
            node has faded out it is also removed from the document again.
        </p>

            recent action of a player. These elements were created as described earlier.</p>

    <div id="lessons_learned">
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>All in all, the project went very well. We did not have any notable problems. Of course, there are always
            things you know better afterwards: </p>
        <p>Assign websocket connection to the player to avoid vulnerability because all cards are sent over the network
            to all players.
        </p>
        <p>Using existing solutions for recurring problems (PokerSolver) saves a lot of time.</p>
        <p>setTimeout() is tricky to handle and can interfere with Websocket communication timings.</p>
        <p>There’s no real z-index in SVG, this means the elements that appear later in the document lie on top of
            elements that were defined earlier in the document and this can not be changed. Therefore, the layout of the
            SVG document should be considered thoroughly upfront.

    <div id="limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>To keep the scope of the project reasonable, we had to make some compromises which limit our application with
            regards to "real world usability":</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>4 Player Limit:</b> The game can only be player by exactly 4 players, no less and no more. This would
                be an easy fix, but was planed like this from the beginning.
            </li>
            <li><b>Easy to cheat:</b> In our implementation, the server sends the complete game state to all players.
                This means, that each player will receive information about the hands of the other players. This is very
                obviously an easy opportunity for cheating. We developed the app under the assumption of only having
                honest players(us 4).
            </li>
            <li><b>Only one Table:</b> The server state allows for exactly one table/game to be open at a time.</li>
        </ul>
